My second website where I applied my new knowledge on CSS and HTMl, mainly the PHP. This is one is different than my first one, mainly because I worked on multipled HTML pages and had to code much more CSS. This one I really enjoyed the most because I already had the idea on how to implement the design I had. My first, #Fruitbazar website was more harder than that is it was my very first attempt on creating a webpage. 

coffee-shop-arabica is also back-end functional using PHP and MySQL. Although I got some help on this part of the project, I am looking forward to fully improve my skills on PHP as well. 

I can say I learned a lot but unfortunately, the webpage is still static and not responsive and that is something I am planning to learn and implement in the near future.
